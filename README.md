# cfp-aggregator

This application can aggregate across various CFP portals and find speakers & talks based on search criteria (company name, etc).

It'll then do something with it. What it does has still yet to be designed :)

Currently it supports the following CFP providers:
- cfp.dev
    - The cfp.dev platform hosts all the CFPs for all the Devoxx and VoxxedDays events

We're also planning to support the [Sessionize](https://www.sessionize.com) & [dev2next](https://www.dev2next) platforms shortly, with others to follow.
